				<h4>What Is Technical Debt?</h4>
				<p>The accumulated cost of shortcuts in code, architecture, or decisions made to move
					faster now, with a trade-off later.</p>
				<aside class="notes">Think of it like financial debt: you borrow time now to ship faster, but you'll pay
					interest‚Äîevery time you touch that messy part of the code again.</aside>

				<h4>Technical Debt In Real Life</h4>

				<section>
					<p>üßπ The Messy Room</p>
					<p>It's like shoving stuff under your bed<br>
						when you're cleaning your room.</p>
					<p><small>It becomes harder to find things or clean properly.</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						You get the job done faster, and it looks clean, but the mess is still there. Eventually, it
						becomes harder to find things or clean properly, and you'll have to spend more time cleaning
						it up later than if you'd just done it right the first time.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>üèóÔ∏è The Construction Shortcut</p>
					<p>It's like building a house with cheap materials<br>
						to meet a deadline.</p>
					<p><small>Soon the walls start cracking, plumbing fails, and you have to spend more time and money
							fixing things</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						You meet your timeline and move in faster, but soon the walls start cracking, plumbing fails,
						and you have to spend more time and money fixing things than if you'd built it properly in the
						first place.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>üõ†Ô∏è The Car Maintenance</p>
					<p>Skipping car maintenance to save time.</p>
					<p><small>You pay more in repairs than if you'd just done the oil change or tire
							replacements.</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						You delay oil changes or tire replacements to keep driving, but eventually, the car breaks down
						at the worst moment‚Äîcosting more time and money to repair.
					</aside>

				<section>
					<p>üçù The Spaghetti Dinner</p>
					<p>You make dinner quickly<br>
						by throwing everything in a pot.</p>
					<p><small>You get a meal fast, but the meal isn't as enjoyable.</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						You get a meal fast, but cleaning up the sticky mess takes longer than if you'd just cooked
						each ingredient properly. Plus, the meal isn't as enjoyable.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>üóÇÔ∏è The Filing Cabinet</p>
					<p>Tossing papers into a drawer<br>
						without organizing them.</p>
					<p><small>You save time now, but when you need a document later,<br>you waste hours digging through
							chaos.</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						You save time now, but when you need a document later, you waste hours digging through chaos.
						If you'd filed them properly, you'd have saved time overall.

					<p>üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Marathon Training</p>
					<p>Skipping early training to save time.</p>
					<p><small>Means you'll hit a wall on race day.</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Cutting corners in preparation makes you faster in the short term, but the pain hits later, when
						it's harder (and more expensive) to recover.

					<p>üí≥ The Credit Card</p>
					<p>Using a credit card to buy time.</p>
					<p><small>You get what you need faster now, but interest accumulates.<br>
							If you don't pay it off, the debt snowballs,<br>
							and you end up paying much more down the road.</small></p>

				<h4>Types of technical debt</h4>

				<h4>How Technical Debt Happens</h4>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Rushed timelines</li>
						<li>Changing requirements with no time to refactor</li>
						<li>Copy-paste or "just get it working" solutions<br>
							<small>AI/Vibe Coding, anyone?</small>
						</li>
						</li>
						<li>Growth without process adaptation</li>
						<li>Lack of documentation or knowledge sharing</li>

					<aside class="notes">Call out that this isn't always due to ‚Äúbad‚Äù developers. it's often

				<h4>Real-World Case Study #1</h4>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Business needed a reporting feature<br>
							to sell the product to a new customer</li>
						<li>The task was given to a newcomer<br>
							without proper onboarding</li>
						<li>After a few months the feature was done<br>
							but the code was a mess,<br>
							and without documentation</li>
						<li>The developer left the company</li>
						<li>The team became afraid to touch it<br>
							and the customer was unhappy</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes"></aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>We tried to fix and improve the code<br>

						<li>We learned the hard way that<br>

				<h4>Real-World Case Study #2</h4>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Our product was built on a legacy framework<br>
							that was no longer actively maintained</li>
						<li>We chose to stick with the legacy version<br>
							to accelerate feature delivery in the short term</li>
						<li>As time passed, many dependencies stopped supporting the legacy version we relied on</li>
						<li>We spent more time resolving compatibility issues<br>
							than developing new features</li>
						<li>Over time, the code became harder to maintain</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes"></aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>We eventually migrated to a modern framework<br>

						<li>We were able to focus on delivering new features<br>
							instead of fixing old problems</li>
						<li>The codebase became much easier to work with</li>
