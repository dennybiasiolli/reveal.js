#### `manage.py squashmigrations`

```text
Optimizing...
  Optimized from 29 operations to 27 operations.
```

```text
Created new squashed migration 0001_squashed_0026_product.py
  You should commit this migration but leave the old ones in
  place; the new migration will be used for new installs.
  Once you are sure all instances of the codebase have
  applied the migrations you squashed, you can delete them.
```

```text
Manual porting required
  Your migrations contained functions that must be manually
  copied over, as we could not safely copy their
  implementation.
  See the comment at the top of the squashed migration
  for details.
