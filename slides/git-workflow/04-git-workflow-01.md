#### git workflow

A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:

1. A Working Directory: where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files

2. A Staging Area: where you'll list changes you make to the working directory

3. A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project
