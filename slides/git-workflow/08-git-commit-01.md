#### git commit

A commit is the last step in our Git workflow.

A commit permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository.

`git commit` is the command we'll do next. However, one more bit of code is needed for a commit: the option -m followed by a message. Here's an example:

```sh
git commit -m "complete first lines of file"
```
