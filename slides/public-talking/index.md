<h3>
My approach<br>
to public talks
</h3>


<aside class="notes">

- 2017, I listened to a "getting started" talk at FOSDEM Bruxelles

    - "Easy, I could do something similar too!"


- 2017, my first talk at "Torino Coding Society"
    - small, local event, friendly environment with colleagues and friends
    - colleagues helped a lot with suggestions about slides, code, etc...
    - getting started guide, almost code-only -> [scared to being exposed as a fraud]
    - [scared to forget what to say] -> write down every single sentence
    - [scared to not be good enough] -> tried a lot of time my talk at home
    - usually a relaxed person -> [nervous, shaking a couple of minutes before the talk]
    - started the talk, finished in half the time
    - tricky question from a colleague (@rmistaken)


I don't know how, but I survived.
Exciting experience, but "never again"


- 2019, I listened to an inspirational talk at PyCon Italy
