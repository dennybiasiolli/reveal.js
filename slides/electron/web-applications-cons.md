#### CONs of web applications

- Conditional rules for dozens of different browser versions

    ```
    <--[if IE]>

    --webkit-border-radius

    navigator.userAgent
    ```

- Limited interaction with the file system

- Performances based on network connection

Can be more painful than writing code for different operating systems
