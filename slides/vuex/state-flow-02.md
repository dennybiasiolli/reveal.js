#### State flow summary

Flow process    | Vue.js component
--------|----
State   | `data` and `computed`
View    | `<template>`
Actions | `methods`


<aside class="notes">
The state is represented by the data and computed section of a Vue component,
the view is the template
and the actions are the methods in our components.

Now, everything seems perfect!
We have our perfect life cycle triggering actions, changing the state and updating the view, right?
We can end this talk and move on to the next one.

No, we have a little, big, problem here.
