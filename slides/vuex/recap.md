Time for a quick recap, what we learned today?

Well, first we saw that Vuex can help a lot in medium and large projects,
making our application more organized and predictable.

Then we learned how to install and configure a Vuex store, moving away from component's logic.

Last, but not least, we saw how to unit test our store and how to mock a
