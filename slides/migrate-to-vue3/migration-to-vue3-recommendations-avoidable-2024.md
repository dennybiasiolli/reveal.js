#### Avoidable migrations(?)

- Jest -> Vitest

    - Why migrate?

        It can leverage the same configuration and transform pipeline directly from Vite

    - Why avoid?

        Jest is still a popular choice for testing Vue applications.
        Only recommended if you have an existing Jest test suite that needs to be migrated over to a Vite-based project
